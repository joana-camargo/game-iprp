Processing game 'Copa 15' for University project

Copa 15 is a football-themed game that challenges players to collect 15 soccer balls while avoiding cones. 

At the beginning of the game, players can choose their favorite team and the theme of the field. The game has three levels of difficulty that gradually increase in challenge. Players control their character using the arrow keys on their keyboard.

Players start with three lives, which are represented by World Cup trophies at the top of the screen. As players collect five soccer balls, they move on to the next level and gain an additional life. Players must avoid cones as they navigate through each level, collecting soccer balls. If a player collides with a cone, they lose a life. If all lives are lost, the game ends.
